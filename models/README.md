# Models Directory

This directory is intended to store trained and serialized machine learning models.

## Usage

Models can be stored here using Git LFS or can be downloaded from an external cloud storage service as described in this README.

## Structure

- Place model files directly in this directory.
- Use Git LFS to track large model files.
- For larger models, provide scripts or instructions for downloading them from external storage.
